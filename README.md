Hi there! I'm Mamie and I'm currently a student at National Chung Hsing University.
I am pursuing a major in Plant Pathology and a double major in Computer Science.
I have always had a strong passion for plants and their diseases, and I believe that studying plant pathology will allow me to contribute to the development of sustainable agricultural practices.  
On the other hand, I am also interested in computer science and its applications in various fields. I enjoy coding and developing software that can solve real-world problems.
